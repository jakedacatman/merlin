He bound to finally get laid, his 31 years of virginity coming to an end. He froze at the sound of a beep, it was his microwave. His taquitos were ready, and he lifted himself up from his chair leaving and orange stain on the black matte finish. An expensive chair his parents had bought him for being a good boy. He sat back down, opened an incognito tab and started to do his business to his 3000 JoJo waifus. Taking a bite of his taquito, the entirety of the insides were spilled onto his sad, erect weiner, leaving only a concoction of semen, salsa, and depression. All in the day of an YBA player.");
